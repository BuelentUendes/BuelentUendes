### Hi there, I'm Buelent and I love to teach and conduct research related to topics of AI and health. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a PhD student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the field of Trustworthy AI
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any AI related projects
- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me pretty much anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: via my Linkedin account which you can access [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/b%C3%BClent-%C3%BCndes-81772a198/?locale=en_US)   
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have the worst sense of direction, which is why friends call me ironically Mr.Kompass
