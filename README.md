### Hi there, I'm Buelent and I love to teach and conduct research related to topics of AI and health. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Junior Lecturer at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any AI related projects
- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me pretty much anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: via my Linkedin account shorturl.at/EFRY4  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have the worst sense of direction, which is why friends call ironically me Mr.Kompass
